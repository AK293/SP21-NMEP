#NOTE: All skeleton code and files come from the NMEP_Sp21 repository from ML@Berkeley and are made by members from ML@Berkeley. I chose to fork their repository because I want to follow along with their Spring 2021 NMEP class so that I can learn machine learning on my own. 

In other words, although all skeleton code, solution pdfs, project descriptions, and files originate from ML@Berkeley, all code that completes the rest of the skeleton code in addition to all code pertaining to the individual projects themselves are written by me.
